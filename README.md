Project Overview
The Millet Yield Prediction app is designed to predict the yield of millet crops based on input data such as moisture content, rainfall, temperature, and soil conditions. The project uses machine learning techniques and provides a simple user interface to input the required parameters and receive predictions.

Data
The model uses the following input features:

Moisture (%): Moisture content in the soil or air (example: 12.80%).

Rainfall (mm): The total amount of rainfall (example: 0.01 mm).

Average Humidity (%): The average humidity percentage during the crop period.

Mean Temperature (Â°C): The average temperature for the region.

Max Temperature (Â°C): The maximum temperature recorded.

Min Temperature (Â°C): The minimum temperature recorded.

Soil Types:

Alkaline Soil: Whether the soil is alkaline (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

Sandy Soil: Whether the soil is sandy (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

Chalky Soil: Whether the soil is chalky (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

Clay Soil: Whether the soil is clay (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

Features
Real-time Predictions: Users can input their environmental data, and the model will predict the millet yield in tonnes per hectare.

Interactive Interface: The app provides a user-friendly interface to input various features like moisture, temperature, and rainfall.

Supports Different Soil Types: Input for different types of soil (alkaline, sandy, clay, chalky).

Installation
To install and run this project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/ravi1v/Millet-yield-prediction.git
cd Millet-yield-prediction
Install dependencies: If you're using Python, create a virtual environment and install required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the app: Once all dependencies are installed, run the application (assuming you're using Streamlit or another framework):

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Enter the Input Data:

Moisture

Rainfall (in mm)

Average Humidity (%)

Mean Temperature (Â°C)

Max Temperature (Â°C)

Min Temperature (Â°C)

Soil types (Alkaline, Sandy, Chalky, Clay)

Prediction: Once all inputs are provided, the app will show the predicted millet yield in tonnes per hectare.
